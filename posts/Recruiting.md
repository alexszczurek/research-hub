# Customer Research and Participant Recruitment: A Comprehensive Guide

Customer research plays a significant role in product development, but the recruitment process for research participants can sometimes be tedious and time-consuming. This process often involves approvals and exchanges with sales, BI, and customer success teams. They are rightly concerned about customer privacy, security, and satisfaction throughout the process, as these factors could affect the company's reputation.

However, with the right tools and processes, not only the UX research team but also product managers, UX designers, and marketers who conduct research can carry out secure and professional recruitment independently.

## Understanding When to Recruit Customers vs External Participants

The most crucial part of any research project is identifying the appropriate audience. Deciding this after the project has commenced can affect the quality of the data you collect. Your choice between recruiting from your customer panel or an external panel like User Interviews hinges on the type of research you're undertaking.

### When to Recruit Your Own Customers

- You are making improvements or updates to the existing experience.
- Your research requires someone already familiar with your product.
- You need to conduct usability tests with power users.

### When to Recruit External Participants

- You are developing a new product or brand.
- You want to test with new customer groups.
- You seek to understand competitorsâ€™ customers.
- You need to test usability among novices.

## Best Practices for Recruiting Customers for Research

Once you've refined your user research question, created an effective research plan, and decided whether you need to speak to current customers or recruit from an external panel, the recruiting process can be straightforward, given the right systems and guidelines.

### 1. Identify Your Target Audience

Identifying the right audience is a critical step in running a successful study. Once you've decided whether you need to speak to current customers or external participants, you need to define the specific segment within that audience. 

### 2. Determine Your Sample Size

Your study goals will help you determine the number of participants required to uncover valuable insights. Consider the potential risks and implications associated with your study goals when determining your ideal sample size. 

### 3. Determine Your Logistics for The Recruit

Time, resources, and budget will significantly impact your recruitment plan. 

### 4. Choose an Attractive Incentive

Select an incentive that compensates your participants fairly and keeps them engaged. 

### 5. Collect Informed Consent

Make sure to provide participants with an informed consent form before participating in research. 

### 6. Build a Strong Screener Survey

Screener questions help validate the behaviors and actions of the participants you're targeting.

### 7. Launch Recruitment and Send Reminders at Ideal Times

Consider the ideal time to send recruitment emailsâ€”when is your target audience most likely to respond?

### 8. Keep Tabs on Your Response Rate and Adapt if Itâ€™s Low

If the response to your recruitment calls is lower than expected, consider increasing the incentive amount or re-evaluating your recruitment criteria. 

In conclusion, a well-planned recruitment process significantly contributes to the success of your customer research. Remember to clearly define your target audience, determine your sample size and logistics, choose an attractive incentive, obtain informed consent, create a strong screener survey, launch recruitment and send reminders at the right times, and monitor your response rate and adjust if necessary.
