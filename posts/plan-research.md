A user research plan outlines a research project's goals, objectives, and logistics, providing a clear overview of who, what, when, why, and how of the research. It serves as a reference point throughout the research process and helps align the research team and stakeholders. It is also essential for reporting research results.

A research plan and a research design are often used interchangeably, though they have slight differences. Research design pertains to the methodology and approach, while a research plan covers logistical considerations such as timelines and budgets.

The necessity of a research plan is emphasized, especially for qualitative research. It helps create alignment and obtain buy-in from stakeholders, focuses on specific research goals, and avoids common pitfalls in user research. The lack of a research plan can lead to increased costs, misalignment, and inefficiencies.

### A comprehensive research plan should include the following:

ðŸ‘‰ **What:** The research question(s) and goals, which should be specific, practical, and actionable.

ðŸ‘‰ **Why:** The business goals that align with the stakeholder's objectives and measures of success.

ðŸ‘‰ **How:** The methodology, explaining the approach to answering the research question. This includes the methods, tools, and timeline of the research.

ðŸ‘‰ **Who:** Information about the participants, including their defining characteristics, recruitment strategies, and how they will be compensated.

ðŸ‘‰ **When and Where:** The research schedule and logistics, including the tools needed, team members' roles, and the timeline of the research.

## Formulating Research Questions
A solid research question is specific, actionable, and pragmatic. It should be concise enough to determine when an answer has been found, practical in terms of feasibly finding answers within the scope of a research project, and actionable in allowing your team to make changes based on your findings. An effective research question guides your research, helps determine when the research is complete, and aligns all stakeholders. Ensure your research question is more investigative rather than validating to maintain an open mindset for new solutions and ideas.

## Compiling Existing Data and Insights
This stage involves determining what you already know or can learn without conducting new user research. You can collect existing information through:

## Stakeholder Interviews
Conducting semi-structured, in-depth interviews at the beginning of a research project to create consensus and align research goals.

## Secondary Research (Literature Reviews)
Collecting and synthesizing existing data and insights on a topic, including reviewing published information related to a topic area to identify patterns and trends.

## Analytics and Customer Feedback
Consulting your companyâ€™s product analytics and customer feedback data can save time researching things your customers have already indicated through their actions and feedback. Coordinate with your product and analytics teams to examine key user flows, in-app behaviors, and business metrics.

## Selecting Appropriate Research Methods
Your research method should be based on your research question. Be careful not to jump directly to methodology as it may limit your study before it begins. Different questions are best answered by different methods such as customer interviews, tree tests, task analysis, or even field studies.

## Research Frameworks
A user research framework is a systematic way of categorizing research methodologies and approaches to guide decisions about which method to use when. You can map methods according to various factors like stages of product development, decisions to be made, your research question, and multiple axes like quantitative versus qualitative, attitudinal versus behavioral, and context of use.

## Design Your Study

In your research plan, specify your study design in the methodology section. Consider the following:

- Moderation method
- Tools required
- Test objectives
- Study outcomes
- Session duration

Establish a research schedule and timeline, accounting for your methodology and participant number. Address budget considerations, participant incentives, venue requirements, and additional software costs.

## Develop a Recruitment Strategy

Recruitment can be challenging. Your research question should guide participant selection. Consider your research method when determining your sample size. Employ a screener survey to filter suitable participants. Establish a plan for distributing incentives post-study.

## Prepare to Share Research Findings

Outline post-research actions, including data analysis and deliverables. Plan your research analysis before commencing the study. Decide on how to present findings to stakeholders, be it progressive sharing or a final report. Plan to share your results in relevant formats, tell a compelling story with your data, and store insights in a repository for future reference.
