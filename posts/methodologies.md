Various methodologies are often optimally effective in specific scenarios. Some strategies tend to yield positive outcomes when integrated with certain complementary methods. Furthermore, nearly all approaches tend to produce more substantial insights when incorporated into a well-rounded hybrid research strategy.

The fundamental differences between **qualitative** and **quantitative UX research** revolve around data collection procedures and the inherent nature of the data.

## **Qualitative UX Research**

Qualitative UX research usually entails gathering data through direct observation of a select group of individuals, aiming to evaluate behavior and answer the question, "Why?" Common qualitative research methods encompass interviews, focus groups, field studies, usability tests, and co-design sessions.

## **Quantitative UX Research**

Conversely, quantitative UX research often involves gathering data from a considerably larger group of people, intending to quantify an issue by addressing the questions, "How much?" and "How many?" Typical quantitative research methods include usability studies, surveys, click tests, card sorts, and A/B tests.

The choice of research method depends on the nature of your question. The qualitative and quantitative data produced by each research type have distinct strengths and limitations.

Quantitative data provides precise and unequivocal information about variables like quantity, frequency, and extent. Its numerical form facilitates easier analysis, yet it can sometimes lack context. For instance, while quantitative research can quickly and efficiently reveal how frequently a user group performs a specific task, the value of this information hinges on having the necessary context to determine whether that task performance rate is satisfactory.

## **The Complementary Nature of Qualitative and Quantitative Data**

Analyzing and interpreting qualitative data can pose more challenges. Presented as unstructured or semi-structured observational findings, such as comments, preferences, and motivations, qualitative data often embeds context. However, it does not produce definitive outcomes, instead depending on researcher interpretation. Still, it can help pinpoint the root causes of behaviors, facilitating the development of suitable solutions.

Though these two types of data may appear vastly different, they actually complement each other remarkably well. Whenever in doubt, **combine methods** for a more comprehensive view of the problem you're attempting to solve.

As Jakob Nielsen of Nielsen Norman Group eloquently articulated:

"Quantitative studies necessitate impeccable accuracy in every detail, or the numbers will mislead. There are so many pitfalls that you're likely to fall into one and encounter difficulties. If you lean on numbers without insights, you'll lack a safety net when things go awry. You'll wander down the wrong path, as that's where the numbers will guide you. Qualitative studies, being less brittle, are less prone to shattering under the weight of a few methodological flaws. Even if your study is not perfect in every last detail, a qualitative method relying on understanding users and their observed behavior will still yield mostly beneficial results."

# **Examining Different Types of Qualitative Research**

Qualitative research methods can be subdivided into five primary research types:

1. **Ethnographic**: Observing study participants in their natural environment enhances understanding of context, cultural insights, and daily lives of the participants.
2. **Narrative**: Conducting in-depth research, typically interviews, with a small number of people to unearth narrative themes demonstrating how various factors can impact events and relationships.
3. **Phenomenological**: Employing an assortment of tactics (interviews, observation, documentation, etc.) to describe and interpret a specific phenomenon or event, including participant perceptions and motivations.
4. **Grounded theory**: Undertaking long-term, in-depth research to uncover the social and psychological processes underlying an event or situation, including its causes.
5. **Case studies**: Offering a detailed account, either explanatory or exploratory, of an individual, organization, or event that reflects real-world occurrences.

This overview succinctly encapsulates the differences between qualitative and quantitative research. If you're seeking a more extensive exploration of the **qualitative vs. quantitative discourse**, rest assured, we've dedicated an entire chapter to the topic.

# **User Research Methods: Generative vs. Evaluative**

Understanding the specific types of user research methods is critical in delivering a product or solution that truly meets the needs of your users. These methods are often categorized as generative or evaluative, and they each have distinct purposes and timing within the research process.

## **Generative User Research Methods**

Generative research, or foundational, exploratory, or discovery research, aims to provide a deep, detailed understanding of your audience, the market, and even your project goals. The objective is to explore the personas of your potential users beyond superficial descriptions, delving into their experiences, beliefs, motivations, and behavior.

Generative research is not just about understanding your users' demographics. It focuses on the *real-world individuals* that might eventually become users. These methods use direct observation, profound inquiry, and meticulous analysis to fully understand the individuals in question.

This type of research is invaluable for identifying opportunities for innovation. It ensures the development of solutions that meet real and specific market needs, mitigating the risk of producing a product that nobody wants.

## **Evaluative User Research Methods**

Evaluative research is primarily used to gauge people’s responses to a product or solution. It usually takes place later in the product development process. Evaluative methods provide valuable insights as soon as you have an initial concept and should be consistently employed throughout the design and development process. By continuously seeking feedback on your design iterations, you ensure that the final product delivers the desired experience and meets user needs effectively.

Together, generative and evaluative methods form two essential halves of a whole. The former helps you identify and define the problem to be solved, while the latter ensures that your solution effectively meets this need.

### **Discovery (Generative) Methods**

Generative research methods include stakeholder interviews to unveil internal goals, field studies for real-life context, and in-depth user interviews. These methods offer researchers an extensive view of participant engagement, including verbal responses, actions, behavior, and body language.

### **Evaluative Methods**

Evaluative research methods are vast and varied. They are used to validate whether your ongoing design effectively addresses the problem identified during generative research. These methods employ different approaches like tree testing, qualitative usability testing, accessibility testing, A/B testing, and more to pinpoint what works and what doesn’t in your design.

## **Continuous Research Methods**

The research process does not end once your product is launched. Engaging in ongoing conversations with your users through methods such as NPS and other feedback surveys, product analytics, and customer support channels is crucial for maintaining your product's long-term value to users.

Continuous research methods offer invaluable insights into users' real-life experiences with your product and help you adapt and evolve as user needs and market conditions change. Maintaining open communication and actively listening to your users ensures that your product remains relevant and valuable over time.

# **User Research Methods: Attitudinal vs. Behavioral, Remote vs. In-person**

Understanding user behavior and attitudes is paramount for delivering a product or service that meets users' needs. This involves using a blend of attitudinal and behavioral research methods. Moreover, choosing whether to conduct the research remotely or in-person is another crucial aspect to consider.

## **Attitudinal and Behavioral User Research Methods**

Contrary to what we might like to believe, there is often a discrepancy between what people say they do and what they actually do. Uncovering this difference is where the blend of attitudinal and behavioral research methods comes in.

### **Attitudinal Research Methods**

Attitudinal research methods are based on self-reported data, reflecting people's stated beliefs, perceptions, and expectations. They include interviews, surveys, focus groups, and card sorts, where participants communicate their thoughts.

Despite the value of attitudinal research insights, they must be interpreted carefully. Participants might not be able to fully express their thoughts or predict their behavior accurately. Nonetheless, attitudinal research can be instrumental in understanding a participant's mental model, shaping the design to meet user expectations better.

### **Behavioral Research Methods**

Behavioral research methods, on the other hand, are based on direct observation of a participant interacting with a prototype or product. These methods, which include eye tracking, A/B tests, tree tests, first-click tests, and user analytics, provide reliable insights based on real-world scenarios.

A combination of attitudinal and behavioral research methods is typically the best practice, providing a comprehensive understanding of user behavior and attitudes.

## **Remote and In-person User Research**

The choice between remote and in-person research primarily depends on the participants' and researchers' locations. Each approach has distinct benefits.

### **In-person Research**

In-person research offers a comprehensive view of participant responses, combining verbal responses and task-related actions with non-verbal cues. It offers several advantages:

- Ease of moderation, with more attentive participants.
- Opportunity to ask follow-up questions and understand participant choices better.
- Control over the environment, including devices, software, internet connection, and data security.
- Better group dynamics, promoting idea generation and useful dialogue.

### **Remote Research**

Remote research provides greater flexibility and cost-effectiveness. The advantages include:

- Greater scheduling flexibility due to no travel requirements.
- Lower costs, eliminating space-related expenses.
- Easier recruitment of a larger and more diverse group of participants.
- Fewer recruitment constraints related to availability or geographical location.
- More accurate reflection of real-life usage, as participants use their own equipment.

However, certain research methods, like ethnographic field studies, might not be suited for remote research. Nevertheless, in many scenarios, the benefits of in-person research can be replicated remotely, combining flexibility and cost-effectiveness without compromising response quality.

# **User Research Methods: Moderated vs. Unmoderated**

In user research, understanding the differences between moderated and unmoderated methods is crucial as it significantly influences the researcher's role, the research execution, and the type of data obtained.

## **Unmoderated User Research Methods**

Unmoderated, or automated, research involves tests that participants complete independently, at their own pace. This occurs through an online platform or software where they are prompted to answer specific questions or perform particular tasks.

The benefits of unmoderated research methods lie in their convenience, affordability, and speed. They primarily yield quantitative data, though certain tests allow for self-narration recording, contributing qualitative data. Common unmoderated research methods include surveys, first-click tests, A/B tests, and user analytics.

## **Moderated User Research Methods**

In contrast, moderated research requires a facilitator to observe participants in person or remotely during the study. This real-time moderation allows researchers to adjust their script and process based on participant actions and engagement. It also provides opportunities to ask probing follow-up questions to understand why participants make certain choices.

The human element in moderated tests makes them more time-consuming and costly. They require additional expertise and preparation, given the specific skill set necessary to moderate a study effectively. Analyzing the results may require more time as they often generate qualitative data. Research methods typically moderated include interviews, ethnographic field studies, focus groups, and task analysis.

Moderated and unmoderated research methods offer unique benefits and can provide valuable insights when appropriately utilized. Selecting the right method largely depends on the nature of the study, the available resources, and the type of data required.
